<p><font size="5">Since an early age, I've always been fascinated with computers. I've learned how to fix hardware and software issues. Currently, I currently have a Computer Information Systems degree, and several other certifications.<br>
I have worked on hundreds of computers and encountered various problems but I have managed to fix them all. I'm not the type of computer technician who will overcharge you because you have little knowledge of computers. <br> 
I will diagnosis your PC or laptop, and after careful analysis, I will thoroughly discuss with you the problem you are having. Thank you for viewing this section, and I hope to do business with you soon. Take care and God Bless. </font></p>
